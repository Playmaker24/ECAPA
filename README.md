# ECAPA
Social Speech Characteristic Prediction using Speaker Embedding from ECAPA-TDNN.  
The architecture model of the ECAPA-TDNN is referenced from [this repository](https://github.com/TaoRuijie/ECAPA-TDNN) by Tao Ruijie.  
The adaptation of the model into our pipeline is to extract speaker embeddings for predicting social speech characteristics such as warmth and competence.
